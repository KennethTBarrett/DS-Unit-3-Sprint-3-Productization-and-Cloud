## Module 1
Today's module went very well; did bare basic setup for a Flask app using python, and everything so far has been very straightforward.

It was definitely interesting to do the database models. It was also fun to start incorporating web elements into the things I'm doing. Outside of some virtual environment issues I was able to resolve, nothing was particularly challenging for me.
