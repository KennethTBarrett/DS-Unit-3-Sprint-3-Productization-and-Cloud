## Module 1
Today's module went very well; did bare basic setup for a Flask app using python, and everything so far has been very straightforward.

It was definitely interesting to do the database models. It was also fun to start incorporating web elements into the things I'm doing. Outside of some virtual environment issues I was able to resolve, nothing was particularly challenging for me.

## Module 2
Today's module wasn't as good simply because I am yet to receive Twitter API access (hoping it will be approved by tomorrow; it's been several days now). This being said, I was able to work a little bit ahead in regard to formatting the HTML and getting it looking nice.

Also, I do have some experience working with APIs, and I've always found them fun to work with. Outside of waiting for API access, so far, this sprint (and entire unit really) has been very straightforward for me. It does help to have a more solid understanding of how websites work, plus this unit has been a blast for me.
